## zonepy
zonal analysis tools for raster and vector datasets

# Introduction

zonepy allows users to complete zonal analysis operations within vector data 
(either user-defined polygon or buffer around a point) to quantify raster 
values (either continuous or percentage of categorical data). 
Vector data can include geodatabases or shapefiles. Raster data can include 
floating (continous data) or integer (categorical data) in geotif format.
